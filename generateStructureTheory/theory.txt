The goal of this restructuring is to help make it easier to understand and to compartmentalize the different code that can be generated.
 The old way of generating pages for example, was very specific, and might not work for a different type of pages later on. 

 Ideally somebody will set a value for something like "page_type" or "style" in the nextGenConfig.json file.
 Based on that value, the generate_pages_controller or the generate_api_routes_controller will call the correct set of pages or api routes to be generated. 
 Basically acting as a router, which points to nicely packed components that pertain to the value of page_type, style, database, etc...


 
Pros: Easier to read the file structure and create new generators based on the NextGenConfig.json

Cons: More code needs to be replicated(but probably needs to be anyways.)
